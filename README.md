## Overview

**ClawX** bridges the gap between powerful AI agents and everyday users. Built on top of [OpenClaw](https://github.com/OpenClaw), it transforms command-line AI orchestration into an accessible, beautiful desktop experience—no terminal required.

Whether you're automating workflows, managing AI-powered channels, or scheduling intelligent tasks, ClawX provides the interface you need to harness AI agents effectively.

ClawX comes pre-configured with best-practice model providers and natively supports Windows as well as multi-language settings. Of course, you can also fine-tune advanced configurations via **Settings → Advanced → Developer Mode**.

## Why ClawX

Building AI agents shouldn't require mastering the command line. ClawX was designed with a simple philosophy: **powerful technology deserves an interface that respects your time.**

| Challenge | ClawX Solution |
|-----------|----------------|
| Complex CLI setup | One-click installation with guided setup wizard |
| Configuration files | Visual settings with real-time validation |
| Process management | Automatic gateway lifecycle management |
| Multiple AI providers | Unified provider configuration panel |
| Skill/plugin installation | Built-in skill marketplace and management |

### OpenClaw Inside

ClawX is built directly upon the official **OpenClaw** core. Instead of requiring a separate installation, we embed the runtime within the application to provide a seamless "battery-included" experience.

We are committed to maintaining strict alignment with the upstream OpenClaw project, ensuring that you always have access to the latest capabilities, stability improvements, and ecosystem compatibility provided by the official releases.

---

## Features

### 🎯 Zero Configuration Barrier
Complete the entire setup—from installation to your first AI interaction—through an intuitive graphical interface. No terminal commands, no YAML files, no environment variable hunting.

### 💬 Intelligent Chat Interface
Communicate with AI agents through a modern chat experience. Support for multiple conversation contexts, message history, rich content rendering with Markdown, and direct `@agent` routing in the main composer for multi-agent setups.
When you target another agent with `@agent`, ClawX switches into that agent's own conversation context directly instead of relaying through the default agent. Agent workspaces stay separate by default, and stronger isolation depends on OpenClaw sandbox settings.

### 📡 Multi-Channel Management
Configure and monitor multiple AI channels simultaneously. Each channel operates independently, allowing you to run specialized agents for different tasks.
Each channel now supports multiple accounts, per-account agent binding, and switching the channel default account directly from the Channels page.

### ⏰ Cron-Based Automation
Schedule AI tasks to run automatically. Define triggers, set intervals, and let your AI agents work around the clock without manual intervention.

### 🧩 Extensible Skill System
Extend your AI agents with pre-built skills. Browse, install, and manage skills through the integrated skill panel—no package managers required.
ClawX also pre-bundles full document-processing skills (`pdf`, `xlsx`, `docx`, `pptx`), deploys them automatically to the managed skills directory (default `~/.openclaw/skills`) on startup, and enables them by default on first install. Additional bundled skills (`find-skills`, `self-improving-agent`, `tavily-search`, `brave-web-search`) are also enabled by default; if required API keys are missing, OpenClaw will surface configuration errors in runtime.  
The Skills page can display skills discovered from multiple OpenClaw sources (managed dir, workspace, and extra skill dirs), and now shows each skill's actual location so you can open the real folder directly.

Environment variables for bundled search skills:
- `BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY` for `brave-web-search`
- `TAVILY_API_KEY` for `tavily-search` (OAuth may also be supported by upstream skill runtime)
- `find-skills` and `self-improving-agent` do not require API keys

### 🔐 Secure Provider Integration
Connect to multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, and more) with credentials stored securely in your system's native keychain. OpenAI supports both API key and browser OAuth (Codex subscription) sign-in.

### 🌙 Adaptive Theming
Light mode, dark mode, or system-synchronized themes. ClawX adapts to your preferences automatically.

### 🚀 Startup Launch Control
In **Settings → General**, you can enable **Launch at system startup** so ClawX starts automatically after login.

---

## Getting Started

### System Requirements

- **Operating System**: macOS 11+, Windows 10+, or Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+)
- **Memory**: 4GB RAM minimum (8GB recommended)
- **Storage**: 1GB available disk space

### Installation

#### Pre-built Releases (Recommended)

Download the latest release for your platform from the [Releases](https://github.com/ValueCell-ai/ClawX/releases) page.

#### Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ValueCell-ai/ClawX.git
cd ClawX

# Initialize the project
pnpm run init

# Start in development mode
pnpm dev
```
### First Launch

When you launch ClawX for the first time, the **Setup Wizard** will guide you through:

1. **Language & Region** – Configure your preferred locale
2. **AI Provider** – Add providers with API keys or OAuth (for providers that support browser/device login)
3. **Skill Bundles** – Select pre-configured skills for common use cases
4. **Verification** – Test your configuration before entering the main interface

The wizard preselects your system language when it is supported, and falls back to English otherwise.

> Note for Moonshot (Kimi): ClawX keeps Kimi web search enabled by default.  
> When Moonshot is configured, ClawX also syncs Kimi web search to the China endpoint (`https://api.moonshot.cn/v1`) in OpenClaw config.

### Proxy Settings

ClawX includes built-in proxy settings for environments where Electron, the OpenClaw Gateway, or channels such as Telegram need to reach the internet through a local proxy client.

Open **Settings → Gateway → Proxy** and configure:

- **Proxy Server**: the default proxy for all requests
- **Bypass Rules**: hosts that should connect directly, separated by semicolons, commas, or new lines
- In **Developer Mode**, you can optionally override:
  - **HTTP Proxy**
  - **HTTPS Proxy**
  - **ALL_PROXY / SOCKS**

Recommended local examples:

```text
Proxy Server: http://127.0.0.1:7890
```
Notes:

- A bare `host:port` value is treated as HTTP.
- If advanced proxy fields are left empty, ClawX falls back to `Proxy Server`.
- Saving proxy settings reapplies Electron networking immediately and restarts the Gateway automatically.
- ClawX also syncs the proxy to OpenClaw's Telegram channel config when Telegram is enabled.
- In **Settings → Advanced → Developer**, you can run **OpenClaw Doctor** to execute `openclaw doctor --json` and inspect the diagnostic output without leaving the app.

## Architecture

ClawX employs a **dual-process architecture** with a unified host API layer. The renderer talks to a single client abstraction, while Electron Main owns protocol selection and process lifecycle:

### Design Principles

- **Process Isolation**: The AI runtime operates in a separate process, ensuring UI responsiveness even during heavy computation
- **Single Entry for Frontend Calls**: Renderer requests go through host-api/api-client; protocol details are hidden behind a stable interface
- **Main-Process Transport Ownership**: Electron Main controls WS/HTTP usage and fallback to IPC for reliability
- **Graceful Recovery**: Built-in reconnect, timeout, and backoff logic handles transient failures automatically
- **Secure Storage**: API keys and sensitive data leverage the operating system's native secure storage mechanisms
- **CORS-Safe by Design**: Local HTTP access is proxied by Main, preventing renderer-side CORS issues

### Communication Regression Checks

When a PR changes communication paths (gateway events, chat runtime send/receive flow, channel delivery, or transport fallback), run:
